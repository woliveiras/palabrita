# Spec 05 — Game

## Summary

The game screen is the core of Palabrita. The player tries to discover the word in up to 6 attempts, Wordle-style. Letters receive visual feedback by position. The player can reveal progressive hints. Difficulty is implicit via word length (4-8 letters), progressing through generation cycles.

## Game Mechanics

### Basic Rules

- The player has **6 attempts** to discover the word
- The word has between **4 and 8 letters** (dynamic per puzzle, determined by generation cycle)
- Each attempt must be a complete word (with the same number of letters)
- After each attempt, each letter receives a color feedback:
  - 🟦 **Mint/Teal** (`#4ECDC4`): correct letter in the correct position
  - 🟧 **Amber/Gold** (`#FFB347`): letter exists in the word but is in the wrong position
  - 🟥 **Coral** (`#FF6B6B`): letter does not exist in the word
- The player can reveal **hints** (maximum 3, progressive from vaguest to most specific; legacy puzzles may have up to 5)
- **Win**: guessing the word in any attempt
- **Loss**: using all 6 attempts without guessing correctly

**Reward rules:**
- Streak: counts **consecutive days played**, regardless of win/loss. Played today = streak maintained.

### Letter Feedback Algorithm

For each attempt, the feedback is calculated as follows:

```
1. Mark all letters in the correct position as CORRECT (mint)
2. For each letter not marked as CORRECT:
   a. Count how many times that letter appears in the target word
   b. Subtract how many times it has already been marked as CORRECT
   c. If there are still remaining occurrences: PRESENT (amber)
   d. If not: ABSENT (coral)
3. Process left to right (for duplicate letters)
```

Example: word = "gatos", attempt = "gagas"
- g[0] → CORRECT (mint)
- a[1] → CORRECT (mint)
- g[2] → ABSENT (coral — 'g' only appears once and has already been used)
- a[3] → ABSENT (coral — 'a' only appears once and has already been used)
- s[4] → CORRECT (mint)

### Puzzle Selection

```
1. Fetch next unplayed puzzle: PuzzleDao.getNextUnplayed(language) — ordered by word length within the batch
2. If exists: use this puzzle
3. If not found (no pre-generated puzzles):
   a. AI Mode: prompt user to generate more (triggers new generation cycle)
   b. Light Mode: fetch from static dataset
4. Mark puzzle as "in game" (create GameSessionEntity)
```

### Attempt Validation

Before accepting an attempt:
- Must have exactly the same number of letters as the target word
- Must contain only `[a-z]` characters
- **NOT** necessary to validate if it is a real word (V1 — no local dictionary)

## UI — Compose

### General Layout

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ ← │ CHALLENGE 2/3 │ 💡 3/5  │  ← Contextual header
├──────────────────────────────┤
│                              │
│     ┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐          │

│     └─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘          │
│                              │

│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│

│  └──────────────────────────┘│
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

### Components

**WordGrid**
- Rows: 6 (fixed — maximum attempts)
- Columns: dynamic (4-8, based on word length)
- Each cell: `Box` with centered `Text` + color background
- Flip animation when revealing feedback (after submitting attempt)
- Shake animation on row if attempt is invalid (wrong length)
- Bounce/pop animation on correct guess (all cells mint)

**GameKeyboard**
- QWERTY layout (adapted to locale if necessary — V1 uses standard QWERTY)
- Each key shows color state based on attempts:
  - Unused: neutral color
  - CORRECT in any attempt: mint (`#4ECDC4`)
  - PRESENT in any attempt: amber (`#FFB347`)
  - ABSENT in all attempts: coral (`#FF6B6B`)
- Special keys: Backspace (⌫) and Enter (↵)
- Keys with accessible touch size

**HintButton**
- Floating or fixed below the grid
- Shows: lightbulb icon + "Hint (X/N)" where N is the total hints available for this puzzle (3 or 5 for legacy)
- On click: reveals the next hint (card slide-in animation)
- Revealed hint stays visible until the end of the game
- If all hints revealed: button disabled

**HintCard**
- Card with the revealed hint
- Numbering: "Hint 1:", "Hint 2:", etc.
- Position: between the grid and the keyboard (scrollable if necessary)
- Animation: fade-in + slide from bottom

### Contextual Header

The game header shows different context for dailies vs free play:

| Mode | Header | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Daily Challenge | "CHALLENGE N/3" | "CHALLENGE 2/3" |
| Free Play | "FREE" | "FREE" |

**Header elements:**
- **Left**: back button (←) with confirmation "Abandon game?"
- **Center**: game context ("CHALLENGE N/3" or "FREE")
- **Right**: hints counter (💡 3/5)

### Back Button — Confirmation

When pressing ← or system back during an active game:

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│                              │
│    Abandon game?             │
│                              │
│    Your progress in this     │
│    game will be lost.        │
│                              │
│    [Continue playing]        │  ← primary
│    [Abandon]                 │  ← destructive
│                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

- "Continue playing" → closes dialog, returns to game
- "Abandon" → GameSession marked as abandoned, navigates to Home
- If the game is already over (WON/LOST): back navigates directly without confirmation

### Result Screen (Win and Loss)

> **Change (Spec 12):** The Chat Card is now the main CTA of the ResultScreen. See Spec 12 for details on Chat AI Engagement.

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│                              │
│     🎉 Congratulations!      │  ← or "😔 Not this time"
│     You discovered it in 3/6 │  ← or "The word was: GATOS"
│                              │
│     Word: GATOS              │
│                              │
│  ┌────────────────────────┐  │

│                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

**Visual hierarchy:**
1. Result (congratulations/loss + word)
2. **Chat Card** (main CTA — `primaryContainer` bg, `primary` border)
3. Play again (secondary button)
4. Share (ghost button)

**Light Mode:** Chat Card replaced by inline static curiosity (no navigation).

**"Play again":**
- In daily: navigates to the next daily (if available) or to Home
- In free play: starts the next puzzle directly

```
│                              │
│    Next puzzle in XX:XX      │
│                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

### Share Format

> **Change (Spec 11):** Puzzles are unique per player (local AI). There is no "puzzle of the day #123". The share highlights streak and performance.

**Win:**

```

**Details:**
- Header: streak (player identity)
- Context: "Challenge N/3" or "Free"
- Word shown in share (each player has a unique word, no spoiler)
- Category-themed emoji (optional, emoji-free fallback)

## Word Length Progression

Difficulty is implicit via word length (4–8 letters). Players progress through generation cycles that increase the minimum word length over time. See Spec 14 for full details on the cycle system.

| Cycle | Lengths generated |
|-------|-------------------|
| 0     | 4, 5, 6, 7, 8    |
| 1     | 5, 6, 7, 8       |
| 2     | 6, 7, 8          |
| 3     | 7, 8             |
| 4+    | 8                 |

Within each batch, puzzles are served in ascending word-length order (4-letter first, then 5, etc.).

## GameViewModel

### State

```kotlin
data class GameState(
    val puzzle: Puzzle? = null,
    val attempts: List<Attempt> = emptyList(),
    val currentInput: String = "",
    val revealedHints: List<String> = emptyList(),
    val keyboardState: Map<Char, LetterState> = emptyMap(),
    val gameStatus: GameStatus = GameStatus.LOADING,
    val isLoading: Boolean = false,
    val errorRes: Int? = null,
    val gameContext: GameContext = GameContext.FreePlay,
    val showAbandonDialog: Boolean = false,
)

sealed class GameContext {
    data class DailyChallenge(val index: Int, val total: Int = 3) : GameContext()
    data object FreePlay : GameContext()
}

data class Attempt(
    val word: String,
    val feedback: List<LetterFeedback>
)

data class LetterFeedback(
    val letter: Char,
    val state: LetterState
)

enum class LetterState { CORRECT, PRESENT, ABSENT, UNUSED }
enum class GameStatus { PLAYING, WON, LOST, LOADING }
```

### Actions

```kotlin
sealed class GameAction {
    data class TypeLetter(val letter: Char) : GameAction()
    data object DeleteLetter : GameAction()
    data object SubmitAttempt : GameAction()
    data object RevealHint : GameAction()
    data object ShareResult : GameAction()
    data object NavigateToChat : GameAction()
    data object NavigateToStats : GameAction()
    data object LoadNextPuzzle : GameAction()
    data object BackPressed : GameAction()
    data object ConfirmAbandon : GameAction()
    data object DismissAbandonDialog : GameAction()
}
```

## PuzzleGenerationWorker (WorkManager)

- **Trigger**: daily periodic (minimum 15 min WorkManager interval, but set to 24h)
- **Constraint**: device idle or charging (to not impact UX)
- **Logic**:
  1. Check `PuzzleDao.countUnplayed(language)`
  2. If < 3: generate 7 new puzzles via `PuzzleGenerator`
  3. If Light mode: do nothing (static dataset is finite)
- **Retry**: if it fails, WorkManager retries with exponential backoff

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| User types fewer letters and presses Enter | Shake animation on row + ignore |
| Duplicate word (same attempt twice) | Allow (V1 — no restriction) |
| All puzzles played (AI mode) | Show loading, generate inline via PuzzleGenerator |
| All puzzles played (Light mode) | Message "Wait for app update" |
| App closed during game | Save state to GameSessionEntity, restore on reopen |
| Screen rotation | Compose handles automatically (ViewModel preserves state) |
| Physical keyboard | Capture key events and map to GameAction |
